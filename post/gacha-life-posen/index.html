-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://fortrisort.github.io/tags/best-wallpaper/>Best Wallpaper</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://fortrisort.github.io/post/fox-furry-base/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Fox Furry Base : Furry Anthro Fox Base Perfect For Adoptions</span></a>
